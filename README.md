#CollisionSpect

Our idea uses the live location, bearing, and speed, as well as the change of such data over time, for the current vehicle and all nearby vehicles, to predict if a car will run a red light and if that car has a chance of colliding with you. If this occurs, both drivers will be given an alert to stop, such that at least one of them is able to, avoiding the collision.
